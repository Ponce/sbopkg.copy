# Please read the sbopkg.conf(5) man page for information about this
# configuration file, including an explanation of how to set these
# variables.

# The following are variables used by sbopkg.  NOTE:  $TMP and $OUTPUT
# must be exported as both are used by the SlackBuild scripts as well.
# Any of the other variables could be exported as well, if desired.

# The following variables are required and can be tweaked if desired,
# although most users should leave them alone.  Note:  rsync already
# uses --archive, --delete, --no-owner, and --exclude in the main
# sbopkg script so there is no need to add those flags here.
# Similarly, wget already uses the -O options so there is no need to
# add that either.  In general, it is not recommended that users
# change these default values.
