\- Configuration file for sbopkg

.SH DESCRIPTION

The sbopkg.conf file contains configuration settings for
.B sbopkg
(8), a tool for interacting with the SlackBuilds.org ("SBo")
repository, a collection of third-party SlackBuild scripts to build
Slackware packages.  A sample file is provided at
/etc/sbopkg/sbopkg.conf.sample.

The different configuration options are:

.TP 5
.B RSYNCMIRROR
.br
This option allows the user to set the rsync mirror of the SBo
repository that will be used by sbopkg.

The default value of RSYNCMIRROR is slackbuilds.org::slackbuilds.

.TP 5
.B SLACKVER
.br
This option allows the user to set the default Slackware version in
order to rsync with the matching SBo repository.

The default value of SLACKVER is 12.1.

.TP 5
.B LOCALREPO
.br
This option allows the user to set the location of the local rsync
mirror of the SBo repository.

The default value of LOCALREPO is /home/sbo.

.TP 5
.B SRCDIR

source downloads will be saved.

The default value of SRCDIR is /var/cache/sbopkg.

.TP 5

to choose whether to keep a permanent log of packages that are built
with sbopkg in order to go back and review the build, and any errors,
after exiting sbopkg.  If set to YES, this permanent log is saved at
$TMP/sbopkg-build-log.

The default value of KEEPLOG is YES.

.SH OVERRIDING ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
It is possible to set or override environmental variables and pass
them to the SlackBuild scripts when they are built from within sbopkg.
For example, using the following in sbopkg.conf instead of a TMP line:

export TMP:${TMP:-/home/sbo/tmp}

will set $TMP to /home/sbo/tmp for sbopkg purposes (i.e. where sbopkg logs are
kept) and also for building packages (i.e. instead of /tmp/SBo).

You can also pass variables in sbopkg.conf that are not used by sbopkg at all:

export OUTPUT:${OUTPUT:-/home/sbo/packages}

will set $OUTPUT for all SlackBuild packages built from within sbopkg (i.e.
instead of /tmp, which is the default in SBo SlackBuild scripts).
