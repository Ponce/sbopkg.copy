Sbopkg is a command-line and dialog-based tool to synchronize with the
SlackBuilds.org repository, a collection of third-party SlackBuild
scripts to build Slackware packages.  Sbopkg will allow the user to
browse his or her local copy of the repository, read the ChangeLog, display
potential updates to SlackBuilds.org packages, and view the README, SlackBuild,
.info, and slack-desc files for each package.  Sbopkg will also allow the user
to select packages to build and it will download the source code, check the
md5sum, and build a Slackware package.  It will not check dependencies,
automatically install the package, or otherwise track what has been installed.
There are already package tools for Slackware that do those things.  Sbopkg is
one thing and one thing only: a medium to easily browse a local copy of the
SlackBuilds.org repository and build packages from it.

Sbopkg can be also be used strictly from the command line without the
dialog interface, to rsync, read the ChangeLog, view package files,
and build packages.  Typing sbopkg -h will display the command line
options.
