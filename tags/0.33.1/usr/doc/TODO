Sbopkg TODO (in no particular order)
* Add in better traps and error checks so a user can safely exit (by pressing
  Control-C) during the source download or during the package building
  process.  I have spent a _lot_ of time hacking on this but have not come up
  with a workable solution yet.  The problem is that many subprocesses are
  forked off during the package building process and it's difficult to capture
  all the pids.  If anyone wants to help with this, please let me know.
  of sbopkg 0.26.0.
* Include a way to change the sync from rsync to lftp for those who have rsync
  blocked.
* Figure out proper way of testing getopts in order to prevent certain cli
  options from being used together, such as -b and -i.  Right now, there is a
  crude test to prevent -b and -i from being used together, but I know there
  is a better way.
* Add 'long' switches to the cli options, i.e. --build in addition to the
  current -b switch.  This is pretty low priority, IMHO, and something tells
  me that getopts does not like long options anyway.
* Maybe change all instances of 'dialog' to $DIALOG and set $DIALOG to be a
  variable equal to either 'dialog' or 'xdialog' in case someone wanted to run
  sbopkg using xdialog.  I don't know how compatible dialog is with xdialog so
  if there was breakage, I would not want to really address it as being able
  to use xdialog is not important to me.  I prefer dialog anyway.
* More error checking.
* General code cleanups.
