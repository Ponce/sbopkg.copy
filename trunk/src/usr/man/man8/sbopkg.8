.TH SBOPKG 8 "December 2008" sbopkg-SVN ""
.SH NAME
.B sbopkg
\ - The SlackBuilds.org Package Browser

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sbopkg
.B [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Sbopkg is a command-line and dialog-based tool to interact with the
SlackBuilds.org ("SBo") repository, a collection of third-party
SlackBuild scripts to build Slackware packages.

.SH INSTRUCTIONS
Before sbopkg can be used, a configuration file must be created at
/etc/sbopkg/sbopkg.conf.  A sample file is provided at
/etc/sbopkg/sbopkg.conf.new. See
.B sbopkg.conf
(5) for more information about the configuration file.

Sbopkg can be run from the command line by simply invoking "sbopkg."
Doing so will launch the dialog-based interface, and the menus
provided should be fairly self-explanatory.  The main menu allows the
user to rsync with the SlackBuilds.org repository, view the
SlackBuilds.org Changelog, check for potential updates to SBo
packages, display the contents of the local cache directory where
source tarballs are saved, display the permanent build log, and browse
or search the local copy of the SBo repository.  Once the browse
function is chosen, the user can select the category of software to
view.  After choosing a category, the user can then view the various
software packages available in that category within the local SBo
repository.  Selecting a package will display another menu allowing
the user to view the package's README, SlackBuild, .info, or
slack-desc files.  The user can also edit the .info file and
SlackBuild and the edited files will remain after doing an rsync.
Additionally, if sbopkg is run with root privileges, then the user can
choose to build a package as well using either the original SlackBuild
or the locally-edited one, if present.  If using the dialog interface,
and if sbopkg finds a built package for a particular piece of software
in the OUTPUT directory, then sbopkg will automatically add a new menu
entry allowing the user to install the package if he so choosed.
Finally, if KEEPLOG is set to YES in the sbopkg.conf file then a
permanent log of the build process is saved in /tmp/sbopkg-build-log.

Alternatively, sbopkg can be run from the command line without using
the dialog interface.  Executing "sbopkg -h" will display a list of
options available from the command line.

Certain features of sbopkg rely on outside binaries, such as a pager
to view the text files when sbopkg is run from the comamnd line, and
an editor to edit the .info or SlackBuild files.  The pager function
will look to the environmental variable $PAGER and if that variable is
not defined then it will default to 'more.'  Similarly, the edit
function found when sbopkg is used with the dialog interface will look
to $EDITOR and will default to 'vi' if no $EDITOR has been defined.
If the user wants sbopkg to use another $EDITOR, such as nano, then
adding the requisite information in ~/.bashrc, /etc/profile, or other
similar configuration file to export $EDITOR will suffice.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 5
.B -b PACKAGE(s)
Search for and build PACKAGE(s) from the local SBo repository.  If more

#sbopkg -b "foo bar"

will build foo and then bar.

.TP 5
.B -c
Display list of installed SBo packages and potential updates.  This is
an experimental feature.  Please see UPDATELIST-DEBUGGING in the
sbopkg documentation directory to assist with bug reporting.

.TP 5
.B -d DIRECTORY
Manually specify the full path to the DIRECTORY containing the
local SBo repository.

.TP 5
.B -f
Override the default configuration file, which is located by

file.

.TP 5
.B -h
Display the help.

.TP 5
.B -l

Search for PACKAGE(s) by specific PACKAGE name and, if found, display
the README, SlackBuild, .info, and slack-desc files in that order
using $PAGER, which defaults to 'more' as described above.   If more
