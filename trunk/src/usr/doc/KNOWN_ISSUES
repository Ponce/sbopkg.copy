The following are the known user-visible issues in sbopkg or upstream in the
tools it uses:

* in dialog '--inputbox' widgets (the boxes the user types text into) the
  left/right arrows do not navigate in a button context. (They do navigate in
  an editing context.) This does not seem to be an sbopkg issue.

  Workaround: navigate with up/down arrows or tab/shift-tab

* if dialog is run in a terminal emulator and the user exits using the
  window manager's 'close' (or equivalent) button/command, dialog may hang,
  using full CPU capacity and have to be killed. This does not seem to be an
  sbopkg issue.

  Workaround: use dialog's own exit methods - its buttons, escape, ^C, etc.
