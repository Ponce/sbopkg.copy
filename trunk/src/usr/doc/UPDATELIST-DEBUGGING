Starting with sbopkg version 0.0.8, there is a feature that displays
potential updates to SBo packages installed on a user's system.  This
feature is still a work in progress, and bugs are expected.  Most bugs
will manifest themselves as either (a) missing updates -- those
updates that should appear in the list but do not or (b) false
positives -- updates listed in the list that are not really updates at
all.  If you run into either of these problems, please do the
following in order to assist with bug-reporting:

As a root user, please open up /usr/bin/sbopkg in your favorite text
editor and uncomment the following line in the "Variables" section
near the top of the file:

#UPDATE_DEBUG="1"

so that it looks like this:

UPDATE_DEBUG="1"

Then, save the file and rerun sbopkg.  Please select the update
feature as normal and then exit sbopkg.  A permanent log of the update
list will now be saved in $TMP/sbopkg-debug-updatelist.  Please
forward this log to me via email to chess@chessgriffin.com or post in
the sbopkg mailing list, which can be found at the project's homepage:
http://code.google.com/p/sbopkg.

Once you have forwarded or copied the log to a safe location, feel
free to comment out that single line in /usr/bin/sbopkg again, which
will then disable the creation of the permanent update log, keeping
your $TMP clean.  Of course, leaving the line uncommented is fine as
well and will create a new $TMP/sbopkg-debug-updatelist each time the
update feature is used.

Thanks for your help!
