Sbopkg is a command-line and dialog-based tool to synchronize with the
SlackBuilds.org repository, a collection of third-party SlackBuild
scripts to build Slackware packages.  Sbopkg will allow the user to
browse his or her local copy of the repository, read the ChangeLog,
and view the README, SlackBuild, .info, and slack-desc files for each
package.  Sbopkg will also allow the user to select packages to build
and it will download the source code, check the md5sum, and build a
Slackware package.  It will not check dependencies, automatically
install the package, or otherwise track what has been installed.
There are already package tools for Slackware that do those things.
Sbopkg is one thing and one thing only: a medium to easily browse a
local copy of the SlackBuilds.org repository and build packages from
it.

Sbopkg can be also be used strictly from the command line without the
dialog interface, to rsync, read the ChangeLog, view package files,
and build packages.  Typing sbopkg -h will display the command line
options: 

sbopkg v0.0.1
Usage: ./sbopkg [OPTIONS] <packagename(s)>
Options are:
  -b package    Build a package.
  -d localdir   Location of local SlackBuilds.org mirror.
                This is currently set to /home/chess/sbo
  -h            Display this help message.
  -l            Display the SlackBuilds.org ChangeLog.txt and then quit.
  -r            Rsync the SlackBuilds.org respository with
                the local mirror and then quit.
  -s package    Search for a package and, if found, display the README.
