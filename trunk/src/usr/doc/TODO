Sbopkg TODO (in no particular order)
* Add in better traps and error checks so a user can safely exit (by
  pressing Control-C) during the source download or during the package
  building process.  I have spent a _lot_ of time hacking on this but
  have not come up with a workable solution yet.  The problem is that
  many subprocesses are forked off during the package building process
  and it's difficult to capture all the pids.  If anyone want to help
  with this, please let me know.
* Include a way to change the sync from rsync to lftp for those who
  have rsync blocked.
* Add ability to install packages from the command line using a -i
  switch.
* Add a build queue.
* Add 'long' switches to the cli options, i.e. --build in addition to
  the current -b switch.
* Add in ability to edit the *.info file so folks can quickly change
  the version or download link (though they'd also have to change the
  MD5SUM).  UPDATE:  this is now part of sbopkg 0.12.0.
* Perhaps make the MD5SUM check a variable that a user can turn off?
* When using the dialog interface, change the listing of packages to
  be a checklist or radiolist whereby the user can select more than
  one package to build at a time.  This would possibly change how the
  user would be able to view the README, slack-desc etc. since a
  checklist or radiolist would not present the current 'view' menu.
  Not sure how the order of packages selected would be set.
* More error checking.
* General code cleanups.
