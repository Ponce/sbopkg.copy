Sbopkg TODO (in no particular order)
* Change download location of source tarballs.  That way, --delete can
  be added to the rsync call, thus creating a true mirror.  See
  discussion on SBo mailing list on 2008-03-24.
* Add ability to manually edit a package's files (i.e. SlackBuild)
  from within sbopkg -- perhaps call $EDITOR.  This creates the issue of
  how to keep the changes after an rsync, which will clobber everything.
  Possibly do something like append ".sbopkg" to a copy of the SlackBuild
  and then add "--exclude='*.sbopkg'" to the rsync call.  See discussion on
  SBo mailing list on 2008-03-24.  
* Add ability to search or build more than one package at a time using
  command line only.
* When using the dialog interface, change the listing of packages to
  be a checklist or radiolist whereby the user can select more than
  one package to build at a time.  This would possibly change how the
  user would be able to view the README, slack-desc etc. since a
  checklist or radiolist would not present the current 'view' menu.
  Not sure how the order of packages selected would be set.
* Fix the way packages are built in the dialog so the display showing
  the build process cannot be exited.  This is confusing as it
  currently stands and the warning that is displayed is not an
  adequate solution.  Look at how pkgtool removes packges.
* Add ability to view more than just the README from the command line.
* Allow user to change the config file location via command line, i.e.
  with a '-c ~/.sbopkg.conf'
* Include ability to work with more than one repo with different
  Slackware versions, i.e. /home/sbo/11.0 and /home/sbo/12.0.  The
  first menu in the dialog after selecting "Browse" would be a menu
  showing the various Slackware versions in the local mirror.
* More error checking, such as making sure the user running the script
  has write permissions on the local mirror.
* General code cleanups.
