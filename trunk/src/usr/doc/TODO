Sbopkg TODO (in no particular order)
* Add ability to manually edit a package's files (i.e. SlackBuild)
  from within sbopkg -- perhaps call $EDITOR.  This creates the issue of
  how to keep the changes after an rsync, which will clobber everything.
  Possibly do something like append ".sbopkg" to a copy of the SlackBuild
  and then add "--exclude='*.sbopkg'" to the rsync call.  See discussion on
  SBo mailing list on 2008-03-24.  UPDATED:  This is working in 0.0.4
  for the dialog interface, but not the cli yet.
* When using the dialog interface, change the listing of packages to
  be a checklist or radiolist whereby the user can select more than
  one package to build at a time.  This would possibly change how the
  user would be able to view the README, slack-desc etc. since a
  checklist or radiolist would not present the current 'view' menu.
  Not sure how the order of packages selected would be set.
* Add ability to view more than just the README from the command line.
  This was added, but it needs to be improved.  UPDATED:  This works
  much better now.
* Include ability to work with more than one repo with different
  Slackware versions, i.e. /home/sbo/11.0 and /home/sbo/12.0.  The
  first menu in the dialog after selecting "Browse" would be a menu
  showing the various Slackware versions in the local mirror.  UPDATED:
  This was added to version 0.0.6.
* Include ability to search and display updates to installed SBo packages.
  UPDATE:  Preliminary experimental code for this feature first
  appeared in version 0.0.8.
* More error checking.
* General code cleanups.
