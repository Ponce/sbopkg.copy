Sbopkg queuefiles are very simple to create, maintain, and share amongst other
users.  Each queuefile can contain a list of applications to build in order,
from top to bottom.  If the application's name is left alone, it will default
to 'ON,' or selected, in the sbopkg dialog menus when the queuefile is loaded.
If the application's name is prepended with a '-' it will default to 'OFF,' or
deselected, in the dialog menus.

For example, a queuefile might contain:

foo
-bar
baz

In this case, both 'foo' and 'baz' will appear 'ON,' or selected, in the sbopkg
dialog menus, and 'bar' will appear 'OFF,' or deselected.
