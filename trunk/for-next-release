SHORT TERM TODO FOR NEXT RELEASE

1.  Look at slakmagik's 'useless uses of cat' patch.

2.  Look at slakmagik's 'return code reassignment plus' patch

3.  Look at slakmagik's misc patch vs. r420

4.  Fix security issue raised by Phillip Warner:  check to make sure pkgs in
$OUTPUT are root:root permissions.  Also, use idea by slakmagik of 'hiding'
certain menu elements if user is not root.  I think we need to hide the
'Build" and 'Install' choices in the info_item menu, and hide the 'Process
Queue' in the Queue menu.

5.  Work on add_item_to_queue loop so messages are only displayed when a
package is in the queue and the user has to decide whether to replace or skip.
Do not give a message after each item is added.  Maybe that message needs to
only be used in the info_item menu after a package is added or in the search
results page.

6.  See other issues in Phillip's email and also issues raised on sbopkg ML.


7.  Would it be helpful to have a way to run a queue through the update function?
Suppose you have a saved queue with several deps and a final pkg, and some of those
deps have been updated in the repo but the saved queue has older versions.  If
the queue is processed, it will automatically pick up the newer versions, but
that is only for building and those changes are not 'saved' to the queue.
Maybe it would be helpful to be able to update a queue (but not run it).

8.  Maybe standardize all the "Done" type dialogs.  Perhaps create a simple
function that displays "Done" (similar to the empty_queue function) and then
call the function whenever a "Done" message is needed.  We could even set it
so you can pass an argument, which would be specific text depending on what
was 'Done', like:

done_msg () {
MSG=$1
dialog --title "Done" --msgbox "stuff $MSG"
}

...

done_msg "The cache has been cleared"
ok

UPDATE:  I don't think this saves us much.
