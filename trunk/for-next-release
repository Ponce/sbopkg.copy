SHORT TERM TODO FOR NEXT RELEASE

1.  Look at slakmagik's 'useless uses of cat' patch.

2.  Look at slakmagik's 'return code reassignment plus' patch

3.  Look at slakmagik's misc patch vs. r420

4.  See other issues in Phillip's email and also issues raised on sbopkg ML.

5.  Would it be helpful to have a way to run a queue through the update function?
Suppose you have a saved queue with several deps and a final pkg, and some of those
deps have been updated in the repo but the saved queue has older versions.  If
the queue is processed, it will automatically pick up the newer versions, but
that is only for building and those changes are not 'saved' to the queue.
Maybe it would be helpful to be able to update a queue (but not run it).

6.  Maybe standardize all the "Done" type dialogs.  Perhaps create a simple
function that displays "Done" (similar to the empty_queue function) and then
call the function whenever a "Done" message is needed.  We could even set it
so you can pass an argument, which would be specific text depending on what
was 'Done', like:

done_msg () {
MSG=$1
dialog --title "Done" --msgbox "stuff $MSG"
}

...

done_msg "The cache has been cleared"
ok

UPDATE:  I don't think this saves us much.
