sbopkg 0.36.0 (2012-10-04 03:05 UTC)

    FEATURES

        * This release of sbopkg is Slackware 14.0-ready. (Congrats to
          all involved in the Slackware release.)
        * Sbopkg now has a -d flag which can download without building
          or installing, in addition to -b (download, build) and -i
          (download, build, install). Thanks to Kristoffer Karlsson for
          the feature request and some testing and to Mauro Giachero for
          the initial patch and discussion and review of additional
          patching.
        * It is now possible to combine the -r flag with other flags
          such that a sync is performed first. For example 'sbopkg -ri
          foo' will synchronize with the repo and install the latest
          foo.
        * There is a new configuration option, NICE, which enables the
          user to specify a niceness for the execution of the
          SlackBuild. Previously, this was hardcoded to 10 (which is
          still the default). Thanks to Joni Martikainen for the
          suggestion.

    MODIFICATIONS

        * Specifying an alternate directory as repository root from the
          command line, which was done with the -d flag, is now done
          with the -D flag. Sorry for any inconvenience.
        * The 'Build' option in a package's info menu has been renamed
          to 'Process', along with many other minor informational
          changes throughout the UI.
        * The Slamd64 repo file has been removed as that project is
          defunct.
