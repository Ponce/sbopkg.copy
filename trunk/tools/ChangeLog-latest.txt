sbopkg 0.34.1 (2011-02-05 04:20 UTC)

    FEATURES

        * Added Spanish translations of the man pages. Much thanks to
          Pablo Castano Fernandez for doing these translations.

    MODIFICATIONS

        * Revision of documentation. Major reformatting and some textual
          modifications of /usr/doc/sbopkg-*/* including breaking out
          the credits in the script into a detailed THANKS file,
          renaming and reformatting ChangeLog.txt into NEWS, renaming
          the sample queuefiles from *.sqf to *.sqf.sample, and making
          lesser modifications to all the other docs.

    BUGFIXES

        * Fixed issue where MKDIR_PROMPT was being ignored. Thanks to
          catkin for raising this issue.

        * Fixed issue where -o would wrongly produce no output. Thanks
          to ArTourter for raising this issue and to Mauro Giachero for
          the patch.

        * Fixed issue where TAG would sometimes not appear in the final
          package. Thanks to chytraeus for raising this issue.

        * A revision which fixed a failure to properly initialize
          directories when running under bash 3x was committed but
          didn't make it into the released package. It is included in
          this release. Also fixed a problem with a blank line being
          wrongly displayed in the directory initialization output in
          older bashes. Thanks to greinze for pointing the latter out.

        * Fixed documentation bug where the obsolete SBOPKGTMP and
          current TMPDIR variables weren't correctly documented. Thanks
          to dive for raising this issue.

        * Fixed non-documentation bug where TMPDIR wasn't being
          correctly assigned when set in sbopkg.conf. Thanks to Ken
          Roberts for reporting the issue and providing a preliminary
          fix.
