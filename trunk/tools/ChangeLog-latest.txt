Sbopkg 0.34.0 released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * Revised man pages - these are very different and now document a couple of
    previously undocumented things and are worth a (re-)read. Thanks to
    Marie-Claude Collilieux for the French translations of these.
  * The HACKING file now includes a man page style guide in addition to the
    coding style guide.
  * The LOGDIR variable has been removed from sbopkg.conf - DIR can be
    specified in LOGFILE.
  * The DEBUG variable has been renamed to DEBUG_UPDATES in sbopkg.conf.
  * The default timeout values in {WGET,RSYNC}FLAGS have been raised from
    10/15 to 30 in sbopkg.conf.
  * All parameters in sbopkg.conf now use default values only if the variable
    hasn't been previously set (meaning they can all be overridden by passing
    variables on the command line).
  * sbopkg.conf has been reordered - this may make any merging that may be
    needed more interesting this time but hopefully it's worth it.
  * The directory initialization process has been changed - at first run or
    otherwise when encountering missing directories, the user will now be
    presented with a single list of them and a (C)reate/(A)bort prompt.
  * The command line user interface has been overhauled in terms of more
    consistent validated command line messages and prompts.
  * Fix an ARCH display issue in the updates screen; thanks to alkos333, Marc
    Payne, and David Spencer for confirming the issue and thanks to David
    Spencer for testing the fix.
  * Fixed bugs with dzen2 and *zarafa* not downloading/building properly. Note
    that, while the changes fix these issues and should make it easier to
    handle similar problems in the future, this change may introduce
    regressions. If a download or build fails due to a downloaded tarball
    looking something like 'blah?actual_tarball.tar.gz' or the like, please
    report it to us.
  * Fixed bugs with the '-s' option where only the first of multiple
    arguments would be returned and where the command line select menu was
    broken. Also where it and the -g flag might inadvertently expand globs
    wrongly.
  * It's now possible to specify the b,g,i,s flags multiple times. Previously
    multiple arguments to these flags had to be quoted (-b "foo bar") but now
    they can be given as '-b foo -b bar'. The original style is still
    supported.
  * With the new style of passing multiple arguments, it is now possible to
    specify app-specific options on the command line. These take the form of,
    e.g., '-i app1:opt1="foo bar":opt2=baz app2:opt=mu'. If that's cryptic,
    see the manual for details.
  * Users now have the option of interactively retrying a failed https
    download, invoking wget with '--no-check-certificate', as this can be
    caused by 'self-signed certificates' and the like.
