Sbopkg 0.XX.X released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * Commit a patch that adds a new sbopkg.conf configuration variable,
    QUEUEDIR, where users can define where saved queues are stored; also, when
    the user wants to load a saved queue, show a list of available saved
    queues; thanks to slakmagik for the patch.
  * Add ability to search for keywords in the README files using regular
    expressions; this new 'string search' can also be narrowed to only search
    installed packages; thanks to slakmagik for the original patch and
    implementation and thanks to both slakmagik and Mauro Giachero for
    cleaning it up and addressing minor issues before the commit.
  * Commit a cleanup/misc patch from slakmagik that removes some useless code
    and fixes some style issues; thanks to slakmagik for the patch.
  * Allow user to interrupt/abort the update progressbar by pressing ESC;
    thanks to Mauro Giachero for the feature.
  * Assorted menu navigation fixes, and document -p switch in sbopkg(8) man
    page; thanks to Mauro Giachero for these improvements.
  * Add ability to view a diff of an edited .info or SlackBuild file before
    choosing which one to use; this feature adds two configuration variables
    to the sbopkg.conf file: DIFF and DIFFOPTS; thanks to Phillip Warner for
    the suggestion and thanks to Mauro Giachero for helping debug/improve my
    original implemenation.
  * Add ability to view more files in each application's folder, i.e.
    doinst.sh, or *.desktop files; thanks to Phillip Warner for the suggestion
    and thanks to slakmagik for the patch implementing this feature.
  * Rework the check for root:root permissions when installing packages; now,
    it will display the output of ls -l <packagename> and ask if the user
    wishes to install or abort, rather than only aborting.
  * Allow the usage of the -d, -f and -v command-line options in dialog mode,
    and spit an error message when the command line contains unrecognized
    tokens.
  * Move the -q option to -g (General search) in order to make way for -q,
    'quiet mode' where the output of some of the command line options (i.e.
    the command line progressbar) can be minimized.  More quieting will likely
    occur in future releases.  Thanks to alkos333 for the feature request
  * Implement a workaround so that the dialog interface now works better with
    GNU Screen and rxvt-based terminals. Thanks to Phillip Warner for raising
    the issue and thanks to Mauro Giachero for working on the implementation.
  * Include a French translation of the two sbopkg man pages.  For now, these
    man pages will be included in the /doc directory until I have time to
    figure out whether they can be automatically installed in place of the
    English ones depending on a locale setting.  In any event, I would like to
    extend my thanks to Marie-Claude Collilieux for providing this first
    translation for sbopkg.  I am sure folks will appreciate the work she put
    into it.  If anyone else wants to follow her lead and provide some other
    translations, I would be happy to include them.  Thanks Marie-Claude!
  * Add in several patches from slakmagik that lets user choose from saved
    queues, modifies how the saved queues and backup queues work, and modifies
    several other queue-related functions and menus.  Many thanks to slakmagik
    for his continually excellent contributions.
