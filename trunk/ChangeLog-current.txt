Sbopkg 0.XX.X released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * Add in new update code by Mauro Giachero.
  * Change how selecting/unselecting items in the build queue are handled.
    Now, when items are unselected, they remain in the queue but are turned
    "OFF."
  * Improve how packages are added to the queue.  The user is now prompted if
    they want to replace items already in the queue or skip them.
  * Merge in a large whitespace/cleanup patch by slakmagik which greatly
    improves the readability of the code.
