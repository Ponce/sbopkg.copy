Sbopkg 0.XX.X released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * Move sbopkg to /usr/sbin; update sbopkg.SlackBuild and sspm to reflect
    /usr/sbin.
  * Change default directory paths in sbopkg.conf.new; add new variable
    SBOPKGTMP, which will be used to store sbopkg-related temp files; also
    add new variable LOGDIR which will contain any sbopkg-related log files.
  * Remove code related to user-mode support; sbopkg must now be run as
    root in all cases; add single check at start of script to make sure we
    are root.
  * Apply a major code cleanup that touches just about every part of sbopkg.
    This cleanup makes the code more readable, manageable, and less bug-prone.
    Several bugs were fixed as part of this cleanup, and the cleanup will ease
    further development and debugging efforts.
  * Remove some useless code from check_for_latest and also fix the
    download folder for sbopkg updates.  Thanks to David Somero for the bug
    report.
  * Re-implement the code that checks for renamed software; fix upgrading
    of renamed packages; thanks to Phillip Warner for raising the issues
    with the older code; thanks to Mauro Giachero for working on these fixes.
  * Fix a tr invocation issue where in certain instances, sbopkg would not run
    from certain directories; thanks to Marie-Claude Collilieux for the bug
    report.
  * Alter sed expression in download code to work around calcurse filename
    idiosyncrasy; thanks to Glenn Becker for the bug report.
  * Move French man pages into correct /usr/man/fr* location and remove them
    from the /docs directory; update French man pages; thanks to
    Marie-Claude Collilieux.
  * Remove a stale 'find' call, which slightly improves the update feature.
  * Add acroread->adobe-reader, GNOME-Colors->gnome-colors, wbxml2->libwbxml
    and museek-plus->museek+ renames.
  * Display a message when no packages are installed instead of doing nothing.
  * Properly quote the current working directory variable in the event there
    are spaces in the directory name.
  * Fix a bug where 'sbopkg -c -v local' would display a dialog even though
    running in cli mode.
  * Fix issue where the 'games' directory was non-browsable due to a
    slack-desc file containing double-quotes in the first line; thanks to
    Glenn Becker for the original bug report.
  * Implement configurable repository support by introducing a new
    /etc/sbopkg/repos.d directory where separate repositories files can be
    maintained and also by adding support for git-based repositories.  The
    Slamd64Builds repository is now listed, to the joy of all the Slamd64
    users out there.  Add a new document README-repos.d that explains how
    these repository files work.
  * 'Nice' the build process so as to improve sbopkg's resource utilization.
  * Fix a few issues regarding user sbopkg.conf files.
  * Move sbopkg-renames to new /etc/sbopkg/renames.d/50-default to manage
    multiple renames files.  Thanks to Robby Workman for the suggestion.  Add
    new document README-renames.d that explains how this works.
  * Add support for new *.txz, *.tlz, and *.tbz Slackware package extensions.
  * Rewrite several portions of the process_queue function in order to
    properly handle certain items by the caller; clean up and improve the
    logging displayed during the build process.
  * Require build queuefiles have a '.sqf' file extension.
  * Add a sanity check for files in sbopkg's temp directory.
  * Cleanup several of the functions related to editing the .info and
    SlackBuild files to remove code duplication; also cleanup and fix issues
    associated with the two primary search functions, and improve file cleanup
    for these search-related functions.
  * Fix issue where MD5SUM checking would fail when certain upstream packages
    do not change source file name on version updates by adding in an extra
    check for existing sources.  Additionally, add an option to retry a source
    download in the event of an MD5SUM failure to avoid having to restart a
    build.  Thanks to David Spencer for raising these issues and thanks to
    Mauro Giachero for the fixes and improvements.
  * Create a ChangeLog.txt for git repos on the fly.
  * Remove usage of ARCH in preparation for Slackware64 support.
  * Remove obsolete load_backup_queue.
  * Improve and fix some issues with the search functions and leaking
    variables.
  * Change queuefile format.  No longer will the queuefile format be 'APP
    VERSION ON/OFF' but instead will simply be one 'APP' per line.  If a user
    wants an APP to be deselected in the dialog menus, simply put a '-' in
    front of it, e.g. '-APP'.  This should make creating, using, and sharing
    queuefiles much easier and more intuitive.
  * Add ability to load more than one queuefile at a time when building
    from command line interface.
  * Add several new functions related to checking GPG-signed tarballs, such as
    those that SlackBuilds.org provides.  Sbopkg will now automatically check
    these tarballs when building or installing a package.  Additionally, there
    are two new menu items in info_item that allow the user to check the GPG
    signature or re-extract the GPG-signed tarball.
  * The info_item dialog now shows non-SBo installed packages and gained a
    more robust approach to finding both the installed package names and
    the available packages in $OUTPUT.
  * Add ability to dump all installed packages into a build queue.  This is an
    alphabetical list, so shuffling/reordering of the queue will be necessary
    in order to list the dependencies correctly, but at least this will give
    users a head start on setting up a large build queue.
  * The process of searching for obsolete source archives can now be
    interrupted with ESC.
  * Add several new functions related to checking GPG-signed tarballs, such as
    those that SlackBuilds.org provides.  Sbopkg will now automatically check
    these tarballs when building or installing a package.  Additionally, there
    are two new menu items in info_item that allow the user to check the GPG
    signature or re-extract the GPG-signed tarball.
  * Add ability to have recursive queuefiles, so one queuefile named
    "foo.sqf" may have an entry "@bar" in which case as the foo.sqf
    queuefile is parsed, it will recursively go down into the 'bar.sqf'
    queuefile as well.  The '@' symbol is used in front of an entry in a
    queuefile to denote another queuefile.
  * Remove the old "$APP $VERSION$BUILD $ONOFF" format for the temporary queue
    and instead make all queue formats "$APP" only.  This simplifies some code
    and results in a small speed increase.
  * Exit edit_build_queue menu with 'ESC'; thanks to Nille for the bug report.
  * Modify do_install() to correctly invoke upgradepkg to avoid a fairly rare
    but serious case of removing the wrong package; thanks to NaCl for the
    bug report.
  * Add ability to pass build options in a queuefile when separated by a pipe
    character, i.e. app | FOO=yes BAR=no
