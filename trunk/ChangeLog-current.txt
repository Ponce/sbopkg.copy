Sbopkg 0.XX.X released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * Commit a patch that adds a new sbopkg.conf configuration variable,
    QUEUEDIR, where users can define where saved queues are stored; also, when
    the user wants to load a saved queue, show a list of available saved
    queues; thanks to slakmagik for the patch.
  * Add ability to search for keywords in the README files using regular
    expressions; thanks to slakmagik for the original patch and implementation
    and thanks to both slakmagik and Mauro for cleaning it up and addressing
    minor issues before the commit.
  * Commit a cleanup/misc patch from slakmagik that removes some useless code
    and fixes some style issues; thanks to slakmagik for the patch.
  * Allow user to interrupt/abort the update progressbar by pressing ESC;
    thanks to Mauro for the feature.
  * Assorted menu navigation fixes, and document -p switch in sbopkg(8) man
    page; thanks to Mauro for these improvements.
  * Add ability to view a diff of an edited .info or SlackBuild file before
    choosing which one to use; thanks to Phillip Warner for the suggestion and
    thanks to Mauro Giachero for helping debug/improve my original
    implemenation.
  * Add ability to view more files in each application's folder, i.e.
    doinst.sh, or *.desktop files; thanks to Phillip Warner for the suggestion
    and thanks to slakmagik for the patch implementing this feature.
  * Rework the check for root:root permissions when installing packages; now,
    it will display the output of ls -l <packagename> and ask the user they
    wish to install or abort, rather than only aborting.
  * Allow the usage of the -d, -f and -v command-line options in dialog mode,
    and spit an error message when the command line contains unrecognized
    tokens.
