Sbopkg 0.XX.X released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * Move sbopkg to /usr/sbin; update sbopkg.SlackBuild and sspm to reflect
    /usr/sbin.
  * Change default directory paths in sbopkg.conf.new; add new variable
    SBOPKGTMP, which will be used to store sbopkg-related temp files; also
    add new variable LOGDIR which will contain any sbopkg-related log files.
  * Remove code related to user-mode support; sbopkg must now be run as
    root in all cases; add single check at start of script to make sure we
    are root.
  * Apply a major code cleanup that touches just about every part of sbopkg.
    This cleanup makes the code more readable, manageable, and less bug-prone.
    Several bugs were fixed as part of this cleanup, and the cleanup will ease
    further development and debugging efforts.
  * Remove some useless code from check_for_latest and also fix the
    download folder for sbopkg updates.  Thanks to David Somero for the bug
    report.
  * Re-implement the code that checks for renamed software; fix upgrading
    of renamed packages; thanks to Phillip Warner for raising the issues
    with the older code; add wbxml2->libwbxml to sbopkg-renames; thanks to
    Mauro Giachero for working on these fixes.
  * Fix a tr invocation issue where in certain instances, sbopkg would not run
    from certain directories; thanks to Marie-Claude Collilieux for the bug
    report.
  * Alter sed expression in download code to work around calcurse filename
    idiosyncrasy; thanks to Glenn Becker for the bug report.
  * Move French man pages into correct /usr/man/fr* location and remove them
    from the /docs directory; update French man pages; thanks to
    Marie-Claude Collilieux.
  * Remove a stale 'find' call, which slightly improves the update feature.
  * Add acroread->adobe-reader and GNOME-Colors->gnome-colors to
    sbopkg-renames.new.
  * Display a message when no packages are installed instead of doing nothing.
  * Properly quote the current working directory variable in the event there
    are spaces in the directory name.
  * Fix a bug where 'sbopkg -c -v local' would display a dialog even though
    running in cli mode.
  * Fix issue where the 'games' directory was non-browsable due to a
    slack-desc file containing double-quotes in the first line; thanks to
    Glenn Becker for the original bug report.
  * Implement configurable repository support, and use it to support
    git-based repositories. The Slamd64Builds repository is now listed, for
    the joy of all the Slamd64 users out there.
  * 'Nice' the build process so as to improve sbopkg's resource utilization.
  * Fix a few issues regarding user sbopkg.conf files.
  * Move sbopkg-renames to new /etc/sbopkg/renames.d/50-default to manage
    multiple renames files.  Thanks to Robby Workman for the suggestion.  Add
    new document README-renames.d that explains how this works.
  * Add support for new *.txz, *.tlz, and *.tbz Slackware package extensions.
