Sbopkg 0.XX.X released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * Fix typo in 50-default renames file.
  * Fix the "Uncheck installed" feature. The code apparently worked fine even
    without the fix. Spotted by slakmagik.
  * Add $ARCH information in dialog backtitles.
  * Add ":force" to sbopkg.conf WGETFLAGS --progress=bar to correctly
    display the wget progress bar; thanks to happyslacker for nudging me on
    this issue again.
  * Fix an issue with the build options dialog menu where selecting 'None'
    would not work; thanks to happyslacker for the bug report.
