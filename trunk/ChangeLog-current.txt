Sbopkg 0.XX.X released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * Add in new update code by Mauro Giachero.  This /greatly/ improves how the
    updates are handled and virtually eliminates the need for specific
    application quirks.  Please note there is a new file
    /etc/sbopkg/sbopkg-renames that handles a few name changes.  If you
    upgrade sbopkg with the new package, then this file will be automatically
    installed.  If not, you'll need to grab this file from the source tarball
    and move it there manually.  Many thanks to Mauro for the hard work in
    finally getting the update code done right.  :-)
  * Change how selecting/unselecting items in the build queue are handled.
    Now, when items are unselected, they remain in the queue but are turned
    "OFF" and when the queue is processed, only those packages turned "ON"
    will be built or installed.
  * Improve how packages are added to the queue.  The user is now prompted if
    they want to replace items already in the queue or skip them.  This may be
    helpful if a user has saved a queue with lots of dependencies that are
    then updated through the rsync process.  The updates can be added to the
    queue, replacing the old versions.
  * Merge in a large whitespace/cleanup patch by slakmagik which greatly
    improves the readability of the code; thanks to slakmagik for the patch.
  * Replace the 'Clear Queue' menu item with 'Delete Queue Items' which
    provides the user the ability to delete individual items in the queue or
    clear the entire build queue.
  * Add in ability to have a /local directory in the local SBo repository tree
    on a user's system that is in parallel with other SBo directories (i.e.
    /home/sbo/local).  As long as this directory is maintained in an SBo style
    (including user-defined categories), then sbopkg will pick them up and the
    user can change their SLACKVER to 'local' and build/install packages from
    there.  This might be useful in testing pre-submissions to SBo or for
    maintaining other software not in SBo.  This was inspired by a similar
    idea contributed by slakmagik.  Please see the sbopkg.conf(5) man page for
    more information.
  * Commit a patch from slakmagik that adds a new sbopkg.conf variable LOGFILE
    where the user can decide the name and location of the permanent build
    log, if used; thanks to slakmagik for the patch.
  * Fix issue where downloaded sources with spaces in their file names would
    cause an MD5SUM failure; thanks to alkos333 for the bug report, and thanks
    to Mauro Giachero for improving my initial bug fix implementation.
  * Commit several other patches from slakmagik that improve the handling of
    the search box upon search failures; tweak the precheck log a bit; improve
    the checking of root privilegs, and improve the handling of the
    directory-creation checks; thanks to slakmagik for these patches.
  * Fix issue where a failed download would still go through an md5sum check;
    now it informs the user of the failed download and asks if the user wishes
    to continue with the build queue or abort.
  * Lots of other internal 'under the hood' improvements to the repository
    browsing, directory check functionality, build queue, and just general
    overall code cleanup.
