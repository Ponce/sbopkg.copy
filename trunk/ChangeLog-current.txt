Sbopkg 0.XX.X released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * Move sbopkg to /usr/sbin; move French man pages to /usr/man/fr/man*;
    update sbopkg.SlackBuild and sspm to reflect /usr/sbin.
  * Change default directory paths in sbopkg.conf.new; add new variable
    SBOPKGTMP, which will be used to store sbopkg-related temp files; also
    add new variable LOGDIR which will contain any sbopkg-related log files.
  * Remove code related to user-mode support; sbopkg must now be run as
    root in all cases; add single check at start of script to make sure we
    are root.
  * Re-implement the code that checks for renamed software; fix upgrading
    of renamed packages; thanks to Phillip Warner for raising the issues
    with the older code; add wbxml2->libwbxml to sbopkg-renames; thanks to
    Mauro Giachero for working on these fixes.
  * Remove some useless code from check_for_latest and also fix the
    download folder for sbopkg updates.  Thanks to David Somero for the bug
    report.
  * Alter sed expression in download code to work around calcurse filename
    idiosyncrasy; thanks to Glenn Becker for the bug report.
  * Update French man pages; correctly name French man pages without the
    _fr tag; ihanks to Marie-Claude Collilieux.
