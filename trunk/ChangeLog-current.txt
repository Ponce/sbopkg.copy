Sbopkg 0.XX.X released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * Add in new update code by Mauro Giachero.  This greatly improves how the
    updates are handled.  Please note there is a new file
    /etc/sbopkg/sbopkg-renames that handes a few name changes.  If you upgrade
    sbopkg with theh new package, then this file will be automatically
    installed.  If not, you'll need to grab this file from the source tarball
    and move it there manually.
  * Change how selecting/unselecting items in the build queue are handled.
    Now, when items are unselected, they remain in the queue but are turned
    "OFF."
  * Improve how packages are added to the queue.  The user is now prompted if
    they want to replace items already in the queue or skip them.
  * Merge in a large whitespace/cleanup patch by slakmagik which greatly
    improves the readability of the code.
  * Replace the 'Clear Queue' menu item with 'Delete Queue Items' which
    provides the user the to delete individual items in the queue or clear the
    entire build queue.
  * Add in two patches from slakmagik, the first allows the user to have a
    /local/ directory in the local SBo repository where the user can maintain
    individual non-SBo SlackBuilds (in the SBo style, however) which will be
    picked up by sbopkg, the second adds a new sbopkg.conf variable LOGFILE
    where the user can decide the name and location of the permanent build
    log, if used.
