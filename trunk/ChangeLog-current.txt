Sbopkg 0.XX.X released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * Addressed an apparent bash 4.1 bug that causes the 'obsolete sources'
    function to break.
  * Addressed issue 44 where hitting ^C during the download of part of a queue
    and restarting the queue could result in a download failure. Thanks to
    slava18 for the report.
  * Changed the menu order of the "Build options" dialog to default to using
    "Saved" options rather than "None".
  * Fixed issue 45 where packages with '+' in the name were not properly
    detected in some cases. Thanks to skalkoto for the report.
  * Miscellaneous tweaks in preparation for release and to bring in line with
    Slackware 13.1.
