Sbopkg 0.XX.X released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * Fix typo in 50-default renames file.
  * Fix the "Uncheck installed" feature. The code apparently worked fine even
    without the fix. Spotted by slakmagik.
  * Add $ARCH information in dialog backtitles.
  * Add ":force" to sbopkg.conf WGETFLAGS --progress=bar to correctly
    display the wget progress bar; thanks to happyslacker for nudging me on
    this issue again.
  * Fix an issue with the build options dialog menu where selecting 'None'
    would not work; thanks to happyslacker for the bug report.
  * Add the ability to uninstall SBo packages from the dialog interface that
    lists installed packages. Thanks to pokipoki08 for the suggestion.
  * Fix an incompatibility regarding the way bash 3.1, 3.2, and 4.0 handle the
    RHS of [[ commands using the =~ operator which broke the repo file
    validation, among other things. Thanks to SiegeX, Zmyrgel, and BCarey for
    the reports and suggestions.
  * Add the ability to run multiple sbopkg instances simultaneously. This has
    been suggested many times in the past. Users should read the sbopkg.conf
    man page before using this option (which is disabled by default).
  * Be more strict validating YES/NO configuration variables.
  * Add a KNOWN_ISSUES file - if you encounter a bug, check this file before
    reporting it to see if it's known and if there's a workaround.
  * Modify sspm to be root-only and change the default checkout location. In
    case it isn't obvious, this means the checkout will be root-owned if it
    isn't already.
  * Fix cosmetic bug where ARCH and BUILD were not displaying correctly in
    list of updates on x86_64.
