Sbopkg 0.XX.X released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * Add in new update code by Mauro Giachero.  This greatly improves how the
    updates are handled.  Please note there is a new file
    /etc/sbopkg/sbopkg-renames that handles a few name changes.  If you
    upgrade sbopkg with the new package, then this file will be automatically
    installed.  If not, you'll need to grab this file from the source tarball
    and move it there manually.
  * Change how selecting/unselecting items in the build queue are handled.
    Now, when items are unselected, they remain in the queue but are turned
    "OFF."
  * Improve how packages are added to the queue.  The user is now prompted if
    they want to replace items already in the queue or skip them.
  * Merge in a large whitespace/cleanup patch by slakmagik which greatly
    improves the readability of the code; thanks to slakmagik for the patch.
  * Replace the 'Clear Queue' menu item with 'Delete Queue Items' which
    provides the user the to delete individual items in the queue or clear the
    entire build queue.
  * Add in ability to have a /local directory in the local SBo repository tree
    on a user's system that is in parallel with other SBo directories (i.e.
    /home/sbo/local).  As long as this directory is maintained in an SBo style
    (including user-defined categories), then sbopkg will pick them up and the
    user can change their SLACKVER to 'local' and build/install packages from
    there.  This might be useful in testing pre-submissions to SBo or for
    maintaining other software not in SBo.  This was inspired by a similar
    idea contributed by slakmagik.  Please see the sbopkg.conf(5) man page for
    more information.
  * Commit a patch from slakmagik that adds a new sbopkg.conf variable LOGFILE
    where the user can decide the name and location of the permanent build
    log, if used; thanks to slakmagik for the patch.
  * Fix issue where downloaded sources with spaces in their file names would
    cause an MD5SUM failure; thanks to alkos333 for the bug report.
  * Commit several other patches from slakmagik that improve the handling of
    the search box upon search failures; tweak the precheck log a bit; improve
    the checking of root privilegs, and improve the handling of the
    directory-creation checks; thanks to slakmagik for these patches.
