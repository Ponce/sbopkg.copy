Sbopkg 0.XX.X released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * Add several renames to 50-default renames file.
  * Add support for UNSUPPORTED/UNTESTED packages in the SBo repo; thanks to
    artourter for the bug report.
  * Honor the TAG exported by the user.
  * Fix issue where delete sources in package info item menu did not work in
    some cases; thanks to artourter for the report, thanks to slakmagik for
    the hard work in fixing this and thanks to Mauro for the review and
    suggestions.
  * Add the ability to skip the prompts for sbopkg's directory creations. This
    is useful, for example, if you have some SBo/sbopkg directories on a
    temporary filesystem and don't want to be bothered with repeated directory
    creation prompts. Thanks to agikhan for the report.
  * Address an issue where sbopkg could sometimes pick an older package to
    present for installation rather than the most recent one.
