Sbopkg 0.XX.X released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * Implement some security fixes, namely, customize the output of some of the
    menus so only things that can be done as root (i.e. build, install,
    process the queue) are seen by the root user; also add a check to make
    sure only root can install packages and that packages are correctly set
    with root:root permissions.  Thanks to Phillip Warner for the report and
    suggestions.
  * Modify SLACKVER in sbopkg.conf so it can be passed at runtime to sbopkg.
