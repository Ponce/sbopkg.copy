Sbopkg 0.31.1 released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * The ARCH assignment was modified to accord with the latest SBo SlackBuild
    template.
  * Tweaked widgets in select_repository() (no or less scrolling) and
    load_user_queue() (better button) and modified check_gpg() to not disrupt
    the dialog interface with gpg output
  * Revised the KNOWN_ISSUES file and other documentation
