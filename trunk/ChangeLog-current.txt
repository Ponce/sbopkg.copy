Sbopkg 0.XX.X released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * Addressed an apparent bash 4.1 bug that causes the 'obsolete sources'
    function to break.
  * Addressed issue 44 where hitting ^C during the download of part of a queue
    and restarting the queue could result in a download failure. Thanks to
    slava18 for the report.
  * Changed the menu order of the "Build options" dialog to default to using
    "Saved" options rather than "None".
  * Fixed issue 45 where packages with '+' in the name were not properly
    detected in some cases. Thanks to skalkoto for the report.
  * Added a help item to the main menu of the dialog interface with pointers
    to documentation and other resources.
  * Added an option to print the version of sbopkg. We try not to change the
    meaning of flags but note that this does change what was the '-v' flag to
    '-V' and now uses '-v' for its customary 'version' purpose. Note that the
    new -V flag now accepts a '?' argument (sbopkg -V ?) which will display
    the list of valid repositories.
  * Tweak the logic re determining ARCH and modify some ARCH-related
    evals and conditionals in check_for_updates and info_item.
  * Fixed a bug which could result in some sources being missed when checking
    for obsolete sources.
  * Added a command line option '-P' to access the 'remove uninstalled
    packages' function which had previously only been accessible from the
    dialog interface.
  * Miscellaneous tweaks in preparation for release and to bring in line with
    Slackware 13.1.
