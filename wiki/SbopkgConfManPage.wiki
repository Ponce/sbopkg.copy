SBOPKG.CONF(5)                                                                                                                                                               SBOPKG.CONF(5)

NAME
       sbopkg.conf - Configuration file for sbopkg

DESCRIPTION
       The  sbopkg.conf  file  contains  configuration  settings for sbopkg (8), a tool for interacting with the SlackBuilds.org ("SBo") repository, a collection of third-party SlackBuild
       scripts to build Slackware packages.  A sample file is provided at /etc/sbopkg/sbopkg.conf.new.

       The different configuration options are:

       RSYNCMIRROR
            This option allows the user to set the rsync mirror of the SBo repository that will be used by sbopkg.

            The default value of RSYNCMIRROR is slackbuilds.org::slackbuilds.

       SLACKVER
            This option allows the user to set the default Slackware version in order to rsync with the matching SBo repository.

            The default value of SLACKVER is 12.1.

       LOCALREPO
            This option allows the user to set the location of the local rsync mirror of the SBo repository.

            The default value of LOCALREPO is /home/sbo.

       SRCDIR
            This option contains the location of the cache directory where source downloads will be saved.

            The default value of SRCDIR is /var/cache/sbopkg.

       TMP
            This options sets the default directory where certain working files are saved on a temporary basis.

            The default value of TMP is /tmp/SBo.

       KEEPLOG
            This option should be set to YES or NO.  This option allows the user to choose whether to keep a permanent log of packages that are built with sbopkg in order to go  back  and
            review the build, and any errors, after exiting sbopkg.  If set to YES, this permanent log is saved at $TMP/sbopkg-build-log.

            The default value of KEEPLOG is YES.

       TERMBUILD
            This  option  should  be  set to YES or NO.  This option allows the user to have the package building process take place in a regular terminal instead of the dialog interface.
            The advantage of doing so allows the user to use Ctrl-S to pause the output, Ctrl-Q to resume the output, and to page up and down to view the final output.

            The default value of TERMBUILD is NO.

OVERRIDING ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
       It is possible to set or override environmental variables and pass them to the SlackBuild scripts when they are built from within sbopkg.  This is already demonstrated in the  fol-
       lowing line in the sbopkg.conf file:

       export TMP=${TMP:-/tmp/SBo}

       This  sets  $TMP  to  /tmp/SBo  for sbopkg purposes (i.e. where sbopkg logs are kept) and also for building SBo packages within sbopkg (which is current default for SBo SlackBuilds
       already).  Since this variable is exported, it could be changed for both sbopkg and for building SBo packages within sbopkg.  For example, changing this line so it reads:

       export TMP=${TMP:-/home/sbo/tmp}

       would then set $TMP to /home/sbo/tmp for sbopkg and for building SBo packages.

       You can also export variables in sbopkg.conf that are not used by sbopkg at all, as demonstrated by the commented out line towards the bottom of sbopkg.conf:

       export OUTPUT=${OUTPUT:-/tmp}

       $OUTPUT is only used in the SBo SlackBuild scripts.  The default setting of /tmp is the same that is currently used in the SBo SlackBuild scripts.  By uncommenting the $OUTPUT line
       in sbopkg.conf, you can export $OUTPUT for all SlackBuild packages built from within sbopkg.  For example, you could change this to /home/sbo/packages.

       As  you can probably see, by making a few changes to these variables, you could have a completely separated sandbox for SBo purposes -- the repo at /home/sbo, the $TMP directory at
       /home/sbo/tmp, the source cache directory at /home/sbo/cache, and the $OUTPUT directory where compiled packages are saved at /home/sbo/packages.
