SBOPKG.CONF(5)                                                                                                   SBOPKG.CONF(5)

NAME
       sbopkg.conf - Configuration file for sbopkg

DESCRIPTION
       The  sbopkg.conf  file  contains  configuration settings for sbopkg (8), a tool for interacting with the SlackBuilds.org
       ("SBo") repository, a collection of third-party SlackBuild scripts to build Slackware packages.  A sample file  is  pro-
       vided at /etc/sbopkg/sbopkg.conf.sample.

       The different configuration options are:

       RSYNCMIRROR
            This option allows the user to set the rsync mirror of the SBo repository that will be used by sbopkg.

            The default value of RSYNCMIRROR is slackbuilds.org::slackbuilds.

       SLACKVER
            This  option  allows  the user to set the default Slackware version in order to rsync with the matching SBo reposi-
            tory.

            The default value of SLACKVER is 12.1.

       LOCALREPO
            This option allows the user to set the location of the local rsync mirror of the SBo repository.

            The default value of LOCALREPO is /home/sbo.

       SRCDIR
            This option contains the location of the cache directory where source downloads will be saved.

            The default value of SRCDIR is /var/cache/sbopkg.

       TMP
            This options sets the default directory where certain working files are saved on a temporary basis.

            The default value of TMP is /tmp.

       KEEPLOG
            This option should be set to YES or NO.  This option allows the user to choose whether to keep a permanent  log  of
            packages that are build with sbopkg in order to go back and review the build, and any errors, after exiting sbopkg.
            If set to YES, this permanent log is saved at /tmp/sbopkg-build-log.

            The default value of KEEPLOG is YES.
