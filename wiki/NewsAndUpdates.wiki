There is no easy place to post updates/news/errata on the Google Code page, so I've created this wiki page as a place for that sort of stuff.  I also try and post important items to the sbopkg mailing list (please subscribe if you have not already).

There is an sbopkg IRC channel, which is pretty quiet.  Go to irc.freenode.net and join #sbopkg.
