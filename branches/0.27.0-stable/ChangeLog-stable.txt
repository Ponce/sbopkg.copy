Sbopkg 0.XX.X released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * Add museek-plus->museek+ to sbopkg-renames.new.
  * Modify the source fetching code to check the md5sum also of cached
    sources, to fix problems arising with those programs whose source archive
    doesn't change name on version updates. Thanks to David Spencer for
    raising the issue.
