Sbopkg 0.XX.X released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * Remove a stale 'find' call, which slightly improves the update feature.
  * Add acroread->adobe-reader and GNOME-Colors->gnome-colors to
    sbopkg-renames.new.
  * Display a message when no packages are installed instead of doing nothing.
  * Properly quote the current working directory variable in the event there
    are spaces in the directory name.
  * Fix a bug where 'sbopkg -c -v local' would display a dialog even though
    running in cli mode.
  * Fix issue where the 'games' directory was non-browsable due to a
    slack-desc file containing double-quotes in the first line; thanks to
    Glenn Becker for the original bug report.
