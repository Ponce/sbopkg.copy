Sbopkg 0.XX.X released.  This version contains the following fixes and
enhancements:

  * Add museek-plus->museek+ to sbopkg-renames.new.
  * Modify the source fetching code to check the md5sum also of cached
    sources, to fix problems arising with those programs whose source archive
    doesn't change name on version updates. Thanks to David Spencer for
    raising the issue.
  * Edit edit_build_queue menu with 'ESC'; thanks to Nille for the bug report.
  * Modify do_install() to correctly invoke upgradepkg to avoid a fairly rare
    but serious case of removing the wrong package; thanks to NaCl for the
    bug report.
