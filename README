Sbopkg is a command-line and dialog-based tool to synchronize with
the SlackBuilds.org ("SBo") repository, a collection of third-party
SlackBuild scripts to build Slackware packages. Sbopkg is actively
maintained and a new version is released one or more times per
Slackware/SBo release. Numerous people have contributed diffs, bug
reports, and helpful suggestions and they are all mentioned in the
THANKS file in /usr/doc/sbopkg-$VERSION. This utility would not be
anywhere close to its present state without the help of these folks.

Sbopkg will allow the user to:

- Create, browse, and search a local copy of the SBo repository for
  any supported Slackware version.
- Read the SBo ChangeLog.txt.
- Display a list of all SBo packages installed on the user's system.
- Display potential updates to packages installed from SBo.
- View the README, SlackBuild, .info, and slack-desc files for each
  individual piece of software in the repository.
- Copy the original .info file or SlackBuild for editing.
- Automatically download the source code, check the md5sum, and build
  or build and install a Slackware package from either the original
  .info file and SlackBuild or the locally-edited copies.
- Batch queue packages for building or building and installing.
- Load, save, and use sbopkg queuefiles (.sqf), several of which are
  included with the package.
- View the contents of the cache directory (where source code tarballs
  are stored).
- View the permanent build log that is optionally maintained to keep a
  record of the entire compilation process.
- Check for an update to sbopkg itself.

Several outdated screenshots of sbopkg in action can be found here.

Sbopkg will not check dependencies since that is not a feature native
to Slackware. Sbopkg is one thing and one thing only: a medium to
easily browse a local copy of the SlackBuilds.org repository and build
packages from it.

Sbopkg can be also be used strictly from the command line without the
dialog interface, to perform most, if not all, of the same functions
listed above. Typing sbopkg -h will display the command line options.

Please note that while sbopkg has performed well for many users, it is
still in a testing phase.
Please do not use in a production environment and please use a
separate copy/mirror of SlackBuilds.org, or at least make a backup of
any changes to your local copy/mirror before using sbopkg.
